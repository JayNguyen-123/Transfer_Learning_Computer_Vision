# Transfer_Learning_Computer_Vision
 - Train a convolutional neural network for image classification using transfer learning.
 - We have about 120 training images each for ants and bees. There are 75 validation images for each class. Usually, this is a very small dataset to generalize upon, if trained from scratch. Since we are using transfer learning, we should be able to generalize reasonably well.
